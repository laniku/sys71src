Radar bug: #1026516

> Release notes for this change:

Many of the script manager routines that depend on a grafport (to get a font => script code that determines their operation) have an alternate form in which a script code can be passed as a parameter; this is useful when a grafport may not be available. Until now, interfaces for these alternate forms are all private (although they are already being tested for Cube-E). They are now being made public, as various people need them, including N&C and El Kabong applications. The implementation of these routines is the same standard forms; the code that handles the script code parameter is in the Script Manager dispatcher, and it strips this parameter, so by the time we reach the routines themselves, the stack setup is the same as the normal way of calling these routines.

These interfaces are: SCCharByte, SCCharType, SCFindWord, SCTransliterate, SCParseTable, SCLowerText, SCUpperText, SCStripText, SCStripUpperText.


> What was tested:

Full System file build (-e): there is no change in functionality, just moving interfaces. Pasted resulting Script Mgr patches into Cube-E 36++ and ran the system.

Radar bug: #1026795

> Release notes for this change:

As we do for the PowerBook 100, we need to change boxFlag on Macintosh LC II machines
from its original value of boxMacLC to boxMacLCII in PatchIIciROM.a.  We also need
to add a new value that can be returned for gestaltMachineType, gestaltMacLCII.  This has
implications
in several areas of the System.  We need to add a new entry in the machine icon table
for Gestalt (the same icon as the LC) and a new string in the machine name STR# in the
System (ÓMacintosh LC IIÓ), both of which show up in the Finder.  We need to make sure
that Gestalt returns the same value for gestaltHasSoftPowerOff and gestaltSerialAttr
as the Mac LC.  In the ShutDown Manager, we need to set the CLUT to 50% gray on a restart
as we do for an LC.  In the Sound Manager, we need to expand the sound primitive vector
table
to include the LC II.


> What was tested:

On an LC II, verified that boxFlag was set correctly, verified that the right icon and
machine string appear in About This MacintoshÉ, verified that the CLUT was set to 50%
gray on restart, verified that sound input worked.  DidnÕt check the returned values for
gestaltHasSoftPowerOff and gestaltSerialAttr, though.

Radar bug: #1018901

> Release notes for this change:

With the Fonts folder, a font family can be split across several files.  This is a new
behaviour, and
programs that assume that a ÔFONDÕ will contain information about all the fonts belonging
to that
font family will be in for a surprise.  Provide a new call, GetNextFOND, which will take
a handle to
a ÔFONDÕ resource as a parameter, and it will return the next ÔFONDÕ resource in the
resource chain
belonging to the same family.  The LaserWriter driver is currently the only client of
this call.

> What was tested:

The bug states that MacWrite IIÕs ReadMe file does not print correctly under Cube-E.
This was due
to the fact that the LaserWriter driver was looking for a style mapping table in the
first Gevena
ÔFONDÕ it found.  This is the one in the system file, which does not have a style mapping
table.
Because it does not find a style mapping table, it tries to download a bitmapped font.
Instead, the
LaserWriter driver should look for another Geneva ÔFONDÕ.
The LaserWriter driver has been changed to call the new routine GetNextFOND to look for
another
ÔFONDÕ for the same family if the ÔFONDÕ it has does not have a style mapping table.
With this fix,
MacWrite II can print itÕs ReadMe document without any problems, whereas it would print
in
Courier without the fix.
GetNextFOND also has code which checks to see if the ÔFONDÕ is in an override map.  If it
is,
GetNextFOND will search for the map after the first non-override map after the override
map, so
that the same ÔFONDÕ resource will not be returned all the time.  To test this, I placed
a copy of
the Geneve ÔFONDÕ, and the ÔNFNTÕs in the System into a Gibbly and tried to print the
ReadMe file.
This also printed correctly.

Radar bug: #1029361

> Release notes for this change:

Needed to identify floating windows via the windowkind rather than the refcon.  So
started off by adding two new kinds of  windowkinds -- applicationFloatKind(6) and
systemFloatKind(7) -- in windows.h.  Then changed the routine imLayerMouseDown in the
Process Manager file Schedule.c to check the windowkind of the floating layer.  If it is
systemFloatKind and the boolean RouteEvent (plus a couple of other extra safe conditions)
is true the mousedown is sent to the swmDriver.  Otherwise, the event is sent to the
front process.  That way processes can open up the new style floating windows without
being inline aware or having to rely on the swmdriver being around.

> What was tested:

Built the system ran it with Non-TSM aware application (KeyCaps) and tested with Kadokawa
the TSM aware application from Japan.  Worked fine.

> Release notes for this change:

Some CPUÕs cannot play and record at the same time (like the Mac LC, LC II and Vail). A
bit was added to Gestalt called ÒgestaltPlayAndRecordÓ which tells you if a machine can
play and record simultaneously. If the bit is not set, the SndRecord() dialog knows that
it should turn off recording before playing the sound just recorded. Also,
SndNewChannel() knows not to allow a channel to be opened while recording on an LC.

> Release notes for this change:

As we do for the PowerBook 140, we need to change boxFlag on PowerBook 145 machines from
its original value of boxPowerBook170 to boxPowerBook145 in PatchIIciROM.a.  We also need
to add a new value that can be returned for gestaltMachineType, gestaltPowerBook145.
This has implications in several areas of the System.  We need to add a new entry in the
machine icon table for Gestalt (the same icon as the PowerBook 140) and a new string in
the machine name STR# in the System (ÓPowerBook 140.Ó for now, until we announce the
machine (the period at the end will let you tell the difference in the meantime)), both
of which show up in the Finder.  In the ShutDown Manager, we need to close the video
driver at shutdown or restart as we do for the 140 and 170. In the Sound Manager, we need
to expand the sound primitive vector table to include the 145, and fool the Gestalt
attribute table into thinking a 145 is really a 140.

> What was tested:

On a PowerBook 145, verified that boxFlag was set correctly, verified that the right icon
and machine string appear in About This MacintoshÉ, verified that playing a sound and
sound input worked.

Radar bug: #1081805,1086363

> Release notes for this change:

Pre-alpha freeze check-in.  This code fixes the 1081805,1086363 and a number of
unreported bugs that I found while preparing for alpha.  I fixed some patches that run on
68K machines.  Several selectors have moved to the private range and so I reordered the
public ones.  In order to not confuse older version of finder and monitors, the gestalt
selector for display manager has changed from ÔudskÕ to ÔdplyÕ.  That way new code
doesnÕt see old code and old code doesnÕt see new.  There was a persistent multiple
monitor bug that would (if you worked at it) crash your system.  It depended on moving
displays and then waving the cursor as the display manager rearranged the displays.  I
think I have this fixed, but I will keep an eye on it.

I also changed the interfaces a little to simplify walking ALL display (including
inactive ones).

> What was tested:

I have been building and testing with this code for some time.  I spend yesterday and
today really hammering on it on both 68K and PDM machines.  It seems to be holding up
well, but I will be continuing my testing and bug fixes.

Radar bug: 

> Release notes for this change:

Checkin for PDM A2 engineering build on 6/22/93.  ROM timing tables now working.  I will
still need to finalize the contents of the tables with the results of a 6/23 meeting.
Display modes can be flagged as ÒdoesnÕt need confirmationÓ.  Monitors does not ask the
user to verify mode switches to those ÒsafeÓ modes.

Driver can also return information about the connection including that ALL modes are
safe.  This is for devices that KNOW that all the modes are safe.  Saves changing decl
ROMs to include a table of timings.  I expect the portables to use this feature for
640x400 mode switches.

Also (hopefully) fixed pesky, occasional cursor-crash on mode switches.  Fix not required
for alpha.  Down side to this fix is that the cursor is reset (0, 0) on mode switches.  I
will need to figure out exactly what is going on here.

> What was tested:

Built ROM and tested on PDM.  Mode switches to 13Ó & 16Ó modes donÕt require
confirmation.  Switches to VGA and 12Ó modes do.  Tested that Òall modes safeÓ flag
works.  Tried and failed to reproduce cursor crash.  I now know that the mouse position
is outside of the pinrect at the time the cursor is drawn.

Radar bug: 

> Release notes for this change:

Changed DMAddDisplay to add device to devicelist and DMRemoveDisplay to remove device
from devicelist.  Added some new calls to support DMAddDisplay, DMRemoveDisplay and smart
monitors (see header and forthcoming ERS).

Changed the display manager to clear get connection and get timing calls (rather than the
driver).  This was Mike PuckettÕs suggestion.  It makes it so if you add fields, old
drivers donÕt set only some of the fields.

> What was tested:

Build and tested ROM on PDM.  Mode switching still worked.  I to work with Max to be sure
that DMAddDisplay and DMRemoveDisplay work.

> Release notes for this change:

Reality update:  Fix gestalt calls to use new prototype (not code change just type
declarations).  Partially updated gestalt header file (except I did not move the error
declarations that should probably be in Errors.h and I did not change the formatting
differences).

> What was tested:

Build and tested.  Found one technically incorrect declaration (but implemented correctly
in assmbler.  Other than that everything seems to work fine.

Radar bug: #1101633,1098397,1101795,1101636,1102280

> Release notes for this change:

Fixed a number of compatibility bugs (1101633,1098397,1101795,1101636,1102280).

I investigated a number of strategies for compatibility when the main display
changed to a different monitor.  The problem was that there were alway incompatibilities
with some applications and/or performance penalties.

New Implementation:
Exchange the contents the old main device and the new main device so that cached handles
still behave correctly.  There is no performance penalty and (so far) no application
incompatibilities beyond those introduced by the change in size.  I dicussed all these
solutions with Kon Othmer and we both feel this is the base strategy.  The only problem
is that this implementation breaks the connection between a phsyical monitor and its
gDevice.

Rejected implementations:
ÊÊ(1) changing the lo-mem MainDevice field (apps cache this value),
ÊÊ(2) introducing a dummy device in the device list that MainDevice points to and
shadowing and disabling the real main device such that caching MainDevice handle works
(some apps had problems and performance suffered because QD always take the multidevice
case, and boot code assumes that all devices in the device list are active screen devices
and therefore ÔscrnÕ resources are invalid if it finds an extra device),
ÊÊ(3) introducing a dummy device BEFORE the device list and pointed MainDevice at it.
Fixed the boot problems and the performance hit, but broke applications that assume
MainDevice is in device list (including MicroSoft Excel).

Added compatibility model.  Conditionally compiled fixes in a separate file with some
guildlines for making sure these fixes can be turned off.  The CloseView compatilbility
fix is the only one in use.

WARNING:
WARNING:  As of this check in, you must use either Pre-Display Manager Monitors CP or
WARNING:  Psychic TV A4 Monitors CP.  The API changed slightly to clean up the interface
WARNING:  and intermediate versions will crash.
WARNING:


> What was tested:

Built and tested extension with Reality sources.  Margarita regressed most of the
existing bugs and things seemed to work.  I updated SuperMario from reality and built and
tested resolution flipping and new version of monitors on PDM.  Everything seems fine.

Radar bug: #1099391

> Release notes for this change:

Synced to latest Reality changes.  Fixed Apple event notification bugs where applications
were getting events they did not know how to handle and were putting up error messages.
Fixed apple event notification to return pre/post information on display states.  Fixed
notification to procptrs for extensions.  Removed some preliminary data structures that
are not used in DM 1.0.  Support QuickDraw GX.

> What was tested:

Built and ran. Checked mode switches.

> Release notes for this change:

Checked in first try at making Display Manager registration calls usable before the
process manager loads.

Rearranged some defines to where they belong.  Move apple event declarations to
Displays.h and move display manager size bit to Processes.h.

Laid ground work for Res-Ind QD in AppleEvent.

> What was tested:

Built and verified ROM still worked on PDM and mode switching was working.
