Radar bug: 

> Release notes for this change:

Checkin for PDM A2 engineering build on 6/22/93.  ROM timing tables now working.  I will
still need to finalize the contents of the tables with the results of a 6/23 meeting.
Display modes can be flagged as ÒdoesnÕt need confirmationÓ.  Monitors does not ask the
user to verify mode switches to those ÒsafeÓ modes.

Driver can also return information about the connection including that ALL modes are
safe.  This is for devices that KNOW that all the modes are safe.  Saves changing decl
ROMs to include a table of timings.  I expect the portables to use this feature for
640x400 mode switches.

Also (hopefully) fixed pesky, occasional cursor-crash on mode switches.  Fix not required
for alpha.  Down side to this fix is that the cursor is reset (0, 0) on mode switches.  I
will need to figure out exactly what is going on here.

> What was tested:

Built ROM and tested on PDM.  Mode switches to 13Ó & 16Ó modes donÕt require
confirmation.  Switches to VGA and 12Ó modes do.  Tested that Òall modes safeÓ flag
works.  Tried and failed to reproduce cursor crash.  I now know that the mouse position
is outside of the pinrect at the time the cursor is drawn.

Radar bug: 

> Release notes for this change:

Changed DMAddDisplay to add device to devicelist and DMRemoveDisplay to remove device
from devicelist.  Added some new calls to support DMAddDisplay, DMRemoveDisplay and smart
monitors (see header and forthcoming ERS).

Changed the display manager to clear get connection and get timing calls (rather than the
driver).  This was Mike PuckettÕs suggestion.  It makes it so if you add fields, old
drivers donÕt set only some of the fields.

> What was tested:

Build and tested ROM on PDM.  Mode switching still worked.  I to work with Max to be sure
that DMAddDisplay and DMRemoveDisplay work.

Radar bug: #1096920

> Release notes for this change:

Slot Manager not correctly updated in set resolution call.  Really sort of a slot manager
bug: I use the slot manager to enable and disable the functional sResources, but I still
need to call SUpdateSRT after I do so.

> What was tested:

Built and tested mode switching.  This is an identical fix to one made to esher driver.
