> Release notes for this change:

As we do for the PowerBook 100, we need to change boxFlag on Macintosh LC II machines
from its original value of boxMacLC to boxMacLCII in PatchIIciROM.a.  We also need
to add a new value that can be returned for gestaltMachineType, gestaltMacLCII.  This has
implications
in several areas of the System.  We need to add a new entry in the machine icon table
for Gestalt (the same icon as the LC) and a new string in the machine name STR# in the
System (”Macintosh LC II”), both of which show up in the Finder.  We need to make sure
that Gestalt returns the same value for gestaltHasSoftPowerOff and gestaltSerialAttr
as the Mac LC.  In the ShutDown Manager, we need to set the CLUT to 50% gray on a restart
as we do for an LC.  In the Sound Manager, we need to expand the sound primitive vector
table
to include the LC II.


> What was tested:

On an LC II, verified that boxFlag was set correctly, verified that the right icon and
machine string appear in About This Macintosh…, verified that the CLUT was set to 50%
gray on restart, verified that sound input worked.  Didn’t check the returned values for
gestaltHasSoftPowerOff and gestaltSerialAttr, though.

Radar bug: #1026866

> Release notes for this change:

Hardware had an extension that fixes some problems with the PowerBooks.  We’re taking
three of
them for CubeE.  Roll them into PowerMgrPatches.a, and add ‘bugz’ bits to tell the
extension that
these have been fixed in the system.

> What was tested:

These fixes have been verified by the hardware group, both as part of an extension, and
as part of
the base system.

Radar bug: #1031451

> Release notes for this change:

As we do for the PowerBook 140, we need to change boxFlag on PowerBook 145 machines from
its original value of boxPowerBook170 to boxPowerBook145 in PatchIIciROM.a.  We also need
to add a new value that can be returned for gestaltMachineType, gestaltPowerBook145.
This has implications in several areas of the System.  We need to add a new entry in the
machine icon table for Gestalt (the same icon as the PowerBook 140) and a new string in
the machine name STR# in the System (”PowerBook 140.” for now, until we announce the
machine (the period at the end will let you tell the difference in the meantime)), both
of which show up in the Finder.  In the ShutDown Manager, we need to close the video
driver at shutdown or restart as we do for the 140 and 170. In the Sound Manager, we need
to expand the sound primitive vector table to include the 145, and fool the Gestalt
attribute table into thinking a 145 is really a 140.

> What was tested:

On a PowerBook 145, verified that boxFlag was set correctly, verified that the right icon
and machine string appear in About This Macintosh…, verified that playing a sound and
sound input worked.
