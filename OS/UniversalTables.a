;
;	Change History (most recent first):
;
;	 <SM107>	 1/14/94	LB		The product info table for TNTProto1 now uses the Fridgidaire
;									floppy drive and media icons.
;	 <SM106>	12/13/93	PN		Roll in KAOs and Horror changes to support Malcom and AJ
;									machines.
;	 <SM105>	11/19/93	chp		Add hasEnhancedLtalk ProductInfo flag to Cyclone/Tempest
;									products. Support for both internal and external SCSI96 buses on
;									TNT.
;	 <SM104>	11/17/93	KW		added a 40 MHz wombat to the STP product tables.
;	 <SM103>	11/10/93	fau		Added the TNT Product Info Tables.
;	 <SM102>	11/10/93	KW		added STPs own productinfo tables.  Thanks to rich.
;	 <SM101>	 11/9/93	KW		hacked in some changes for STP machines.  Because of the hacks,
;									old quadras, wombats probably will not boot.  I will fix that
;									and make less of a hack after our SCM build
;	 <SM100>	 11/8/93	JRH		boxDBLite16 is now boxPowerBookDuo250. boxDBLite20 is now
;									boxPenLite.
;	  <SM99>	10/21/93	SAM		Roll in <MC7> from cm900ftjesus.
;	   <MC7>	10/21/93	SAM		Added SoundStereoMixing and SoundPlayAndRecord to PDM,
;									ColdFusion, and CarlSagan's Universal tables.
;	  <SM98>	10/21/93	GMR		Roll in <MC6> from mc900ftjesus.
;	   <MC6>	10/20/93	GMR		Fixed the BartExists valid flag for CF so it properly does the
;									optional check for it (as in PDM).
;	  <SM97>	10/10/93	SAM		Roll in <MC4> and <MC5> from mc900ftjesus.
;	   <MC5>	10/10/93	SAM		For PDM: Added hasEnhancedLTalk to PDM/ColdFusion/CarlSagan, cuz
;									they do.
;	   <MC4>	10/10/93	SAM		For PDM:  Changed the PDM labels (since the evt support has been
;									dropped). Removed hasSoftVBL from PDM/CF/CS. Added hasNewMemMgr
;									to all three.  Pointed Carl Sagan's decoder table ptr at PDM's
;									instead of Cold Fusion's (which has a different internal SCSI
;									address...)
;	  <SM96>	 10/6/93	RC		Take Out PDM EVT1 support
;	  <SM95>	 10/1/93	JDR		Updated the snd primitives routine names according to
;									SndPrimitives.a.
;	  <SM94>	 9/25/93	SAM		Backed out the last change.  The productInfo tables should be
;									keyed off of a decoder type.
;	  <SM93>	 9/15/93	PN		Add hasAMIC into ProductInfo table for PDM to fix the Universal
;									build
;	  <SM92>	 8/20/93	chp		The name of the Cyclone interrupt primitives table changed in
;									InterruptHandlers.a. Reflect that change in ProductInfo.
;	  <SM91>	 8/17/93	SAM		Put forSmurf conds around all the smurf junk.
;	  <SM90>	08-16-93	jmp		Changed the PDM VideoInfo record to reflect the fact that PDM
;									uses Slot $9’s sPRAM as is reserved in the NuBusInfo record for
;									PDM.  This fixes the problem where PDMs sPRAM kept getting blown
;									away.
;	  <SM89>	 8/13/93	KW		adding two more smurf wombats
;	  <SM88>	 8/12/93	BG		Removed the ProductInfo for WLCD_C1 as it will never exist.
;									Added ProductInfo (and associated pointers) for Carl Sagan.
;	  <SM87>	 8/11/93	RC		Enabled extra slots on PDM and Cold Fusion for Second Wave Nubus
;									Expansion box
;	  <SM86>	 8/11/93	KW		added some productinfo tables for a few new smurf machines
;	  <SM85>	  8/4/93	GMR		Added separate NuBusInfo table for ColdFusion, and fixed the one
;									for PDM.
;	  <SM84>	08-03-93	jmp		Update the videoinfo records in this file to contain the new
;									field from the HORROR sources.
;	  <SM83>	 7/27/93	GMR		Added Bart flags and base addresses to PDM/ColdFusion tables.
;	  <SM82>	 7/14/93	PN		Add hasHardPowerOff to MacLC external feature
;	  <SM81>	 6/28/93	SAM		Updated the ColdFusion family table to know about the second
;									SCSI bus (ie the SCSI mgr can now handle it!)
;	  <SM80>	 6/24/93	SAM		Added one table for all the ColdFusions (w/o  SCSI2exists for
;									now)
;	  <SM79>	 6/17/93	joe		Added the SoundInLineLevel bit to the PDMInfo records so that
;									Telecaster will turn on its mic preamp.
;	  <SM78>	 6/14/93	kc		Roll in Ludwig.
;	  <SM78>     6/10/93	SAM		Add hasHardPowerOff to PDM info.
;	  <LW14>	 4/29/93	fau		Bug#: 1081636: Added the SoundLineLevelInput to Cyclone and
;									Tempest.  Changed all Sound8BitMono to SoundHasSoundIn.  Added
;									SoundStereoIn where appropriate.  All these are to reflect
;									changes in Reality.
;	  <LW13>	 4/19/93	chp		Fix some documentation.
;	  <LW12>	 4/14/93	fau		Added the required changes for moving CivicExists and
;									SebastianExists to Cyclone/Tempest info tables.  Added hasPRAM
;									to slots A/B for Cyclone/Tempest.
;	  <SM77>	  6/3/93	SAM		Updated PDMs boxflags to correspond with the changes made in
;									InternalOnlyEqu.a
;	  <SM76>	  6/2/93	GMR		Changed PDM's Interrupt table to point to it's own, unique table
;									(for disabling level 3 ints).
;	  <SM75>	 5/25/93	joe		Now the PDM info tables use SndCntlPDM instead of
;									SndCntlCyclone.
;	  <SM74>	 5/19/93	GMR		Moved Sonydriver icon tables over to this file, so we don't have
;									to change the floppy driver for each new machine.
;	  <SM73>	  5/6/93	SAM		Turned SoftVBLs back on for both kinds of PDMs.  Put the VIA1
;									initialization back the way it should be (not the cyclone way) -
;									for PDM.
;	  <SM72>	  5/3/93	RC		Turned on SerialDMA driver for AMIC 2 PDM and made sure that it
;									was not turned on for PDM (EVT1)
;	  <SM71>	 4/22/93	SAM		Changed some offsets in the PDMAMIC2Info table that were added
;									in the previous change.
;	  <SM70>	 4/21/93	SAM		Added an entry for the Evt2 PDMs which have a different CPU id.
;	  <SM69>	 4/15/93	RC		Turned off Serial DMA for PDM
;	  <SM68>	 4/11/93	chp		Add SerialDMA and HAL binding to ProductInfo of Cyclone,
;									Tempest, and PDM. Fix usage of has68kEmulator for dc.l instead
;									of BitVector32 because the latter doesn't accept encoded values.
;	  <SM67>	  4/6/93	fau		Removed the 'slotDisabled' from PDM's NuBus info table so that
;									we can support the Ventana Board.
;	  <SM66>	  4/5/93	jb		Changed "SingerExists" to "AwacsExists" in hasHMC & infoPDM.
;	  <SM65>	 3/31/93	chp		Synchronize SuperMario with Ludwig changes.
;	   <LW9>	 3/24/93	mal		Removed hasinterrupt flag from slot 9 for Cyclone & Tempest.
;	   <LW8>	 3/22/93	fau		Added a new VideoInfoTempest to support a different board id for
;									Tempest.  Note that Cyclone33 and Cyclone40 share the same one,
;									as do Tempest25 and Tempest33 -- this should probably change if
;									these other machines ship.
;	   <LW7>	 3/21/93	fau		Changed the DefaultRSRC for Cyclone40/33 to 4 (maybe NonFPU)
;									from 3 (FPU only).  These should really be equates.
;	  <SM64>	  3/5/93	CCH		Added MaceExists to PDMInfo and Mace address to HMCDecoderInfo.
;	   <LW6>	 2/26/93	fau		Updated the ID for Cyclone40 (HW requested an $F --I don't like
;									it but tough).  Removed all support for Cyclone EVT3.
;	   <LW5>	 2/24/93	chp		Cyclone VIA1 port A initialization updated to take advantage of
;									the new wait/request multiplexer in the rev. 04 PSC.
;	   <LW4>	 2/15/93	FU		Moved the InfoCycloneEVT3 record to be after the other 4 cyclone
;									ones, so that we always compare first against a YMCA-based
;									machine.  Fixed the offset of a couple of tables in
;									InfoCyclone40 that were using InfoCyclone33 as their base!
;	   <LW3>	 2/12/93	GS		Updated the InfoCyclone40 record to conatin the new CPUID for
;									the 40MHz Cyclone.
;	  <SM63>	 2/11/93	CSS		Update Vail tables to indicate Egret8 and VDACAddr (SONORA) is
;									valid.  So that Vail CPU will boot again with SuperMario.
;	  <SM62>	  2/8/93	CSS		Update from Horror: Add OrwellExists to Quadra based machines.
;									This to get the test TestFor OrwellExists to work in the SCSI
;									manager to determine whether to run the SCSI96 SCSI manager or
;									the SCSI96BIOS SCSI manager.  This test may not be the best test
;									for this, but this is the way it was in Horror.
;	  <SM61>	  2/5/93	SAM		Touched up the last touchup.  Sorry about that.
;	  <SM60>	  2/5/93	SAM		Touched up the last checkin.
;	  <SM59>	  2/5/93	RC		Added has68kEmulator to Smurf on Wombat
;	  <SM57>	  2/5/93	SAM		Hey, PDM supports 256 mb of RAM now.  How much does yours?
;	  <SM56>	  2/2/93	GMR		Added SWIM3Exists flag to PDM tables.
;	  <SM55>	 1/27/93	RC		Added the AMICExists flag to PDM
;	   <LW2>	 1/22/93	fau		Expanded the RamInfoTempest table to include all 8 possible
;									banks.
;	  <SM54>	 1/15/93	RC		Took out the auto RAM Disk on Doot of PDM and reset the RAM size
;									to 11 Meg
;	  <SM53>	 1/14/93	PN		Add MacIIsiIntTbl and SndCntlMacIIsi tables for Macsi to make
;									SuperMario boot on si again.
;	  <SM52>	01-13-93	jmp		Pointed VideoInfo Pratt at the CSC super sResource directory.
;	  <SM51>	01-11-93	jmp		Updated various BoxFlag names.
;	  <SM50>	 1/10/93	RC		SWIM support worked on for Smurf on Wombat
;	  <SM49>	 1/10/93	RC		added IWM and SoftPower flags to PDM
;	  <SM48>	12/23/92	RC		Added Support for Smurf on Wombat
;	  <SM47>	12/21/92	SWC		Removed the InfoPrattUnknown ProductInfo table since Pratt has a
;									CPU ID register and thus has no need of an "unknown" table.
;	  <SM46>	12/17/92	RB		Removed some of the LC930 conditionals. Added back other hasXXXX
;									conditionals to make it easier to build 1 off 1 Meg ROMs.
;									Rescued the IIsi from the grave. Added hasYMCA for Cyclone
;									machines and hasHMC for PDM.
;	  <SM45>	 12/9/92	SAM		Changed the CPU ID for PDM .  Added 3 additional CPU IDs for the
;									other PDM "boxes."
;	  <SM44>	 12/9/92	jmp		Changed PDM’s VideoInfo record so that the physical framebuffer
;									base is now at 0 and not 1M.  Also, reflected this changed in
;									the logical base, as well.
;	  <SM43>	 12/5/92	jmp		Temporarily pointed BlackBird’s VideoInfo tables to the
;									“unknown” directory since CSC won’t be ready for initial
;									bring-up (we’ll be using the VSC MMU-based DeclData instead).
;	  <SM42>	 12/5/92	SWC		Added special sound table for DJMEMC machines so their sound
;									hardware initialization can also whack built-in video.
;	  <SM41>	 12/4/92	fau		Added StereoPlayandRecord and StereoMixing external features
;									flags to Cyclone-type machines.
;	  <SM40>	 12/4/92	fau		Added tables for Tempest33 and Cyclone40 and update to use new
;									boxflag names for Cyclone-type machines.  Backed out <SM36>.
;	  <SM39>	 12/1/92	EH		Adding Tables for Blackbird.
;	  <SM38>	 12/1/92	SWC		Added IntHandlerPtr, a pointer to the interrupt handler setup
;									table, to the ProductInfo tables. Removed all the Mac II family
;									tables.
;	  <SM37>	11/30/92	dwc		Added AMIC address to HMCDecoderTable for PDM.
;	  <SM36>	11/23/92	mal		Moved CIVIC baseaddr to new location in DecoderInfo Table since
;									DAFBAddr split with CIVICAddr.
;	  <SM35>	11/23/92	SWC		Added an IMPORT of CudaADBTable and pointed all the Cuda-based
;									machines to it.
;	  <SM34>	11/20/92	fau		Modified the BasesValid2 for Tempest to not have any flags so
;									that GetExtHardwareInfo will uses the YMCA decoder default bases
;									to look and see if a MUNI exists.  Added MUNIExists to Cyclone,
;									CycloneEVT4 and to MMC/YMCADecoder.
;	  <SM33>	11/19/92	SWC		Added PowerManagerPtr, a pointer to the Power Manager primitives
;									table, to the ProductInfo tables. Put build conditionals back
;									in. Obsoleted old tables and grouped them at the end of the file
;									for later permenant deletion.
;	  <SM32>	11/11/92	fau		Add ROM external feature bit and set on for Tempest to indicate
;									that machine has Hard Power off.
;	  <SM31>	11/10/92	RB		Moved four export labels that are undefined under an LC930
;									build.
;	  <SM30>	 11/7/92	jmp		Eliminated the obsolete DAFB and LC VideoInfo records.
;	  <SM29>	 11/7/92	rab		Roll in Horror changes. Comments follow:
;		<H64>	10/17/92	BG		Added information for a possible WLCD33.
;		<H63>	10/16/92	JC		Add ROM external feature bit and set on for Vail and WLCD to
;									indicate that machine has Hard Power off so it can be used by a
;									disk based gestalt patch so that we do not need to add
;									additional items to the table in the disk patch.
;		<H62>	 9/10/92	NJV		Changed Vail table to no longer support simultaneous play and
;									record and pointed sound primitives to new Vail sound primitives
;									table.
;		<H61>	 8/25/92	BG		Modified CPUIDProductLookup table to add a '-*' to the Wombat40F
;									table entry.  Oops.
;		<H54>	 6/30/92	HJR		Cleaned up the NubusInfoDartanian and modified VideoInfoDart to
;									use second wrap of the GSC to prevent QuickDraw bug.
;		<H53>	 6/26/92	BG		Modified InfoWombat20, Wombat25 to have the correct combo
;									resource byte for having an optional FPU (040LC or 040).
;		<H52>	 6/26/92	BG		Added Wombat20,40 and WLCDc1 to the table so that they'll be
;									looked for.
;		<H51>	 6/22/92	BG		Added WLCDc1, Wombat20 and Wombat40L universal table entries, as
;									Prod. Marketing seems to think they will become products
;									sometime in the near future.
;		<H50>	 6/16/92	BG		Changed the WLCD productInfo tables to point at the WLCD NuBus
;									info.  Also changed WLCD default resource combo to 4.
;		<H49>	 6/10/92	BG		Changed the separator in the RamInfoWombat table from 'SamB' to
;									its hex equivalent.  For some reason, Asm was interpreting that
;									as a PASCAL string (??) and adding a length byte to the start of
;									it.
;		<H48>	  6/9/92	BG		Fixed VIA1InitWombat to correctly set PA6 as an INPUT.
;		<H47>	  6/4/92	NJV		Changed InfoVail tables since we can now play and record
;									simultaneously.
;		<H46>	  6/3/92	BG		When I updated the InfoWombat33F ProductInfo entry, I forgot to
;									change the VIA1 ID bits.  Fixed.
;		<H45>	  6/3/92	BG		Rearranged the RamInfoWombat table to have the table-separator
;									marker after banks 6&7 to make the djMEMCMerge code in
;									SizeMemPatch.a a little easier to deal with.
;	  <SM28>	 11/3/92	SWC		Changed SlotEqu.a->Slots.a.
;	  <SM27>	10/30/92	HY		Added SupportsROMDisk feature flag in InfoMacLC product info table.
;	  <SM26>	10/27/92	fau		Added Tempest support.  Removed ASCExists from Cyclone's
;									universal info and added DSPExists and MACEExists to it.
;	  <SM25>	10/25/92	HY		Changed boxflag for InfoMacLC product info table to boxMacLCII.
;	  <SM24>	10/22/92	fau		Updated NubusInfoCyclone to reenable the slots that have been
;									disabled way back in Pandora days.
;	  <SM23>	10/22/92	fau		Deleted MMCExists and YMCAExists from all Cyclone related info.
;									Added DSPExists and MACEExists to those structures.
;	  <SM22>	10/20/92	CCH		Added InfoPDM to list of CPUID machines.
;	  <SM21>	10/18/92	CCH		Added support for the PDM CPU.
;	  <SM20>	10/12/92	RB		For the 1 Meg LC930 ROM, exclude all tables not related to the
;									LC hardware.
;	  <SM19>	 9/30/92	fau		Added support for Cyclone EVT4.  This included a new memory
;									decoder YMCA added to the DecoderKind record, a new
;									CycloneInfoEVT4 record and a new RamInfo record for EVT4.  Also,
;									used bit 21 that was unused in the universal bits for the YMCA.
;									It should eventually be moved to the bit that the MMC uses right
;									now.
;	  <SM18>	 9/25/92	RB		Added a ROM base address for dbLite & Cyclone when booting from
;									RAM that is set to 4 Meg. Made the LC table work with LC II
;									again. This will prevent the normal LC from booting, but at this
;									point we need LC II to boot and not LC.
;	  <SM17>	  9/9/92	RB		Make the Mac LC boot on SuperMario by moving up the ProductInfo
;									for the LC. Changed the DecoderInfo record for VISA (MacLC) to
;									match the real LC ROM (Somehow it got screwed up) and added a
;									sound control vector address for LC.
;	  <SM16>	  9/8/92	chp		For Cyclone, program the VIA1 port A W/Req bit as an output.
;									This makes it a flip-flop which is initialized to “1,” disabling
;									LocalTalk from polling serial characters on SCC port A.
;	  <SM15>	 8/26/92	PN		Set ASCBase globals to a safe location on Cyclone so that
;									application that writes to ASCBase will safely write to ROM
;	  <SM14>	 8/24/92	PN		Take out CycloneboxEVT1 stuff
;	  <SM13>	 8/20/92	CCH		Changed Orwell address to $50F0xxxx space instead of $5000xxxx
;									space.
;	  <SM12>	 8/17/92	CCH		Extended universal support to 96-bit, added versions for
;									ProductInfo and DecoderInfo records, created DecoderAddr field
;									in DecoderInfo for memory controller addresses, moved OrwellAddr
;									field to DecoderAddr field, and started using BitVector32 macro.
;	  <SM10>	 7/27/92	CSS		Disable NewAge for EVT1.
;	   <SM9>	 7/13/92	CCH		Added conditionalized support for Cub Card on Quadra 700.
;	   <SM8>	 6/21/92	RB		Added a table for Cyclone EVT2, renamed the old Cyclone tables
;									CycloneEVT1. The EVT1 support will be deleted later, after all
;									systems have been upgraded to EVT2.
;	   <SM7>	 6/18/92	RB		Added a compile time conditional to temporarily support EVT1
;									Cyclone. Look for 'forEVT1'
;	   <SM6>	  6/4/92	KW		(HJR,H44) Added dockingSlot to Dartanian slot E and enabled
;									Slots C & D for Monet.
;									(BG,H43) Modify some of the Wombat/WLCD universal table entries
;									for optional FPU info, as well as an updated VIA1 CPU ID
;									selection scheme.
;									(NJV,H42) Adding SoundPlayAndRecord bit to ProductInfo Tables of
;									machines that can play and record simultaneously.
;									(BG,H41) Added Wombat(20,25,33,40) and WLCD (20,25) Universal
;									information.
;									(SWC,H40) Updated RamInfoDBLite for expandability up to 40MB.
;									(jmp,H39) Changed the “sRsrcZydecoDir” name to the more generic
;									“sRsrcBFBasedDir” (BF=BoxFlag) name.
;									(AL,H38) Updated the Sonora info for the IHT entry point
;									(changed from $58000000 to $50fc0000).
;									The following H24..H21 came from Universal.a in Horror
;									(NJV,H24) Added SoundPlayAndRecord bit to ProductInfo Tables of
;									machines that can play and record simultaneously.
;									(jmp,H23) Fixed a problem in the VideoInfo MacLC record that I
;									caused in <H21>.
;									(jmp,H22) Changed the “sRsrcZydecoDir” name to the more generic
;									“sRsrcBFBasedDir” (BF=BoxFlag) name.
;									(jmp,H21) Pruned the array of V8 VideoInfo records ’cuz we no
;									longer need ’em.
;	   <SM5>	 5/28/92	KW		Some Horror Stuff.  Moved VisaDecoderTable entry in
;									DecoderLookup in front of Niagra.  Changed VisaDecoderTable.
;									Added PatchRomAddr to OrwellDecoderTable.  Added
;									(1<<PatchROMExists) to InfoQuadra900,InfoQuadra700.
;									VideoInfoDAFB changed to F900000.  Added H20 to nubusInfoMacLC
;	   <SM4>	 5/26/92	CSS		Cyclone roll in.
;	   <SM3>	 5/25/92	RB		Second pass of Cyclone changes...Removing Carnation and 4Square
;									tables.
;	   <SM2>	 5/22/92	RB		Cyclone changes, added tables for Cyclone, and CUDA.
;	   <SM1>	  5/2/92	kc		Roll in Horror. Comments follow:
;	   <H34>	 4/21/92	JC		Add SonoraExistsBit to ExtValid flags for Sonora based machines.
;	   <H33>	 4/20/92	NJV		Adding changes needed to support Patch ROMs
;	   <H32>	 4/19/92	JC		Update Vail and Carnation Nubus Info tables. Move onboard video
;									PRAM to slot B.
;	   <H31>	  4/6/92	SWC		Fixed DBLite's diagnostic ROM base address.
;	   <H30>	  4/3/92	SWC		Added ADB/DebugUtil primitives vector table to ProductInfo for
;									each machine.
;	   <H29>	 3/17/92	SWC		Renamed InfoDBLite->InfoDBLite25 and InfoDBLiteLC->InfoDBLite33
;									to reflect reality. Added InfoDBLite16 and InfoDBLite20 in case
;									we decide to use them.
;	   <H28>	 2/25/92	SWC		Added SoundStereoMixing to the external features for the
;									Carnation and Dartanian boxes.
;	   <H27>	 2/21/92	HJR		Enabled VDAC on NiagraInfo.
;	   <H26>	 2/20/92	JC		Update Carnation product info tables to enable Sonic when second
;									rev Sonoras are available.
;	   <H25>	 2/19/92	JC		Update CPUID Register values for Carnation when not using 1st
;									rev Sonora.
;	   <H24>	02/18/92	jmp		Conditionalized (with “hasSonora1”) the video base addresses for
;									the Sonora-based machines for the upcoming turn of the Sonora
;									hardware.
;	   <H23>	 2/18/92	JC		Changed boxCarnation to boxCarnation33 and boxVail to boxVail25
;									and added support for other Sonora based CPUs when hasSonora1 is
;									false.
;	   <H22>	 2/14/92	JC		Remove alternate ROM Physical address for Sonora based machines.
;	   <H21>	 2/13/92	HJR		Added NiagraExistsBit to Niagra's ProductInfo external features,
;									since Niagra is just a minor variant of Jaws.
;	   <H20>	 1/30/92	SWC		DBLite NuBus: marked slot 9 disabled since we'll be using its
;									PRAM for Power Manager stuff, and enabled slots C and D so that
;									NuBus cards installed in Gemini (docking station) will be
;									recognized.
;	   <H19>	 1/20/92	JC		Use alternate ROM physical Address on Sonora based machines to
;									be able to support Double Exposure on Vail and Enable FPUs on
;									Carnation.
;	   <H18>	01/11/92	jmp		Fixed some types in the InfoCarnation tables.
;	   <H17>	01/11/92	jmp		Added in the two new fields for each of the VideoInfo records in
;									this file.
;	   <H16>	  1/9/92	SWC		Marked slot E in DB-Lite's NubusInfo table as a docking slot so
;									we can figure out which it is without hard-coding it someplace
;									else.
;	   <H15>	12/20/91	JC		Add Carnation 3 slot 16/25/33 Mhz and Vail 16/25 Mhz
;	   <H14>	12/16/91	HJR		Add Tables for Niagra and Dartanian.
;	   <H13>	 12/5/91	SAM		Removed Vail's RAMInfo table cuz it is now indentical to
;									Carnation's table.
;	   <H12>	 12/4/91	SWC		Added 3 new RAM banks to DB-Lite's RAM info table.
;	   <H11>	 12/4/91	SWC		Updated DB-Lite's CPU ID value for final hardware, and added a
;									ProductInfo table for DB-Lite LC. Moved the CPU ID register
;									description and the comment list containing the supported
;									machines here so it'll be next to the CPUID ProductInfo table.
;	   <H10>	 12/4/91	CCH		Changed DBLite, Carnation, Vail to use ProductInfo-based CPUID
;									register scheme. Also reorganized file to be info-type based.
;		<H9>	11/26/91	jmp		Added a “VDAC” for DBLite and updated the framebuffer base
;									address for the DBLite and Sonora tables.
;		<H8>	11/25/91	SAM		Added Vail/Carnation RAMInfo tables.
;		<H7>	11/25/91	CCH		Modified Carnation/Vail's NuBus info table to not nuke
;									SecondWave. Also used standard VIA equates.
;		<H6>	10/30/91	SWC		Added IWM base address to MSC/DB-Lite tables since we now have
;									dynamic support for it in the Sony driver.
;		<H5>	10/22/91	SWC		Removed references to MSCAddr and MSCExists and added
;									MSCChipBit, since MSC is just a variant of the RBV.
;		<H4>	10/15/91	SWC		Added clock/PRAM primitives vector table to ProductInfo for each
;									machine.
;		<H3>	 8/28/91	rww		More header cleanup.
;		<H2>	 8/28/91	rww		Header cleanup.
;		<H1>	 8/28/91	rww		First checked in.
;__________________________________________________________________________________________________

;	From now on, new product and decoder tables should go here. Since we can't patch these
;	tables anyway, from now on they'll be located just underneath the dispatch table at link
;	time, so the file can grow to fill the remaining free space. This should make
;	it much easier to add new CPUs.

;	The DB-Lite and unknown decoder and info tables were moved from Universal.a in order to
;	free up some space there (about 350 bytes).

;
;	CPUID Product Lookup Tables
;
;	All CPUs listed in this table support the CPU ID register scheme.
;
;	For truly hip, way new machines, a new CPU ID is defined (which hopefully will allow
;	us to define new computers to our hearts' content without worrying about running out
;	of IDs. The new register resides at the top of I/O address space ($5FFFFFFC) and is
;	32-bits long. It looks like this:
;
;	Bits:	:	      31 - 16         : 15 - 12 : 11  :     10 - 0      :
;			+-------------------------+---------+-----+-----------------+
;			| signature, always $A55A | 0 to 15 | 0/1 |    id field     |
;			+-------------------------+---------+-----+-----------------+
;
;		Bits 15 to 12 represent the design center:
;				b15 b14 b13 b12  Design center
;				 0   0   0   0   High volume
;				 0   0   0   1   Portables
;				 0   0   1   0   High performance CISC
;				 0   0   1   1   High performance RISC
;		Bit 11 is a 0 if the whole ID exists in this ID register, 1 otherwise
;		Bits 10 to 0 are the actual ID, per design center
;
;	So, the currently defined machines and their CPU IDs are:

;	•••	The following applies only to older CPUs that do not support the
;	•••	CPUID register identification scheme.
;
;   The tables below figure out which logic board we are running on.  Some VIA bits
;	have been dedicated to this task starting with the Mac II.  On other machines,
;	we need to be more clever to determine which board it is.
;
;   For 020/030 based machines, the VIA bits are used.  For the Mac II, IIx, IIcx and
;   SE30 machines, the ID bits are PA6 on VIA1 aand PB3 on VIA2.  Note that on the
;   Mac II, PB3 on VIA 2 is normally an output that controls the MMU, but when read as an
;   input it is pulled high internal to the VIA.
;

;        0   1   Mac II
;        1   0   Mac SE 30
;		 1   1   Mac IIcx
;
;   For newer machines, Via 1 port A has four bits dedicated to a logic board ID.  These bits

; PSC VIA1 vDirA/vBufA Notes:
;
; Because ReqA and ReqB are really used for DMA, they are not wire-ORed to the vSCCWrReq bit
; as on most Macintoshes. This bit instead reads the logical OR of ReqA and ReqB, either of
; which can be masked. This allows WReqA to be used in the traditional sense even while WReqB
; is indicating DMA activity.
;
; NOTE:	PSC revisions earlier than 343S1100-a do not support masking!
;		For these revisions, vSCCWrReq should be reprogrammed as an ouput and latched with
;		a "1" so that polling does not occur on port A due to DMA activity on port B.
