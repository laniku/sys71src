	Change History (most recent first):

		<17>	  10/11/92	JMF		Added KCAP resources for Norsi (Apple Adjustable) keypad,
									domestic keyboard and ISO keyboard.
		<16>	  4/8/92	PKE		#1026586,<cv>: For compatibility, add System 6.0.7 version of
									U.S. KCHR as a second KCHR for US system, with ID 16383. Format
									both KCHRs for easier readability.
		<15>	10/28/91	SAM/KSM	Rolled in Regatta changes.
		
	Regatta History:

		 <2>	  8/7/91	SAM		(MH) Changed two coords in the Tim/Derringer KCAP (10) to
									compensate for a KeyCaps bug.
	
	7.0 Change History:

		<14>	 9/16/91	JSM		Cleanup header, nuke SysVers >= 0x700 stuff, including getting
									rid of hasKCHRTweaks, hasKMAPTweaks, and hasKCAPNames which are
									always the same for ROM and System builds now.
		<13>	 6/11/91	gbm		Take out conditional for Regatta
		<12>	  4/8/91	MH		with pke: Added KCAP resources for TIM/Derringer keyboards. The
									IDs are $0A, $0C, and $0D. ID $0A is the current TIM/Derringer
									built in keyboard. IDs $0C and $0D are the domestic and ISO
									keyboards, respectively, that will be in production and ID $0A
									will be removed.  Regatta only.
		<11>	 2/26/91	PKE		smb,#perCindyR: Change resource name “US” to “U.S.”.
		<10>	 2/23/91	PKE		ngk,#83134: (also per CSD) Remove ‘KCAP’ resource names for 7.0.
		 <9>	  2/1/91	PKE		JSM,#81408: Fix KMAP 5 handling of right Shift, right Control,
									and right Option keys.
		 <8>	12/14/90	PKE		(DC) Fix bug in US KCHR for ISO extended keyboard. This keyboard
									has an extra key that didn’t generate the correct characters (or
									even an event) with the US KCHR. This combo is used in several
									localized versions. (fixes BRC #65484).
		 <7>	 5/13/90	PKE		Moved hasKCHRTweaks definition inside “if forROM” conditional.
		 <6>	 5/13/90	PKE		Put in US KCHR changes: (1) Ignore CapsLock if Cmd key down. (2)
									If neither Opt-key nor Opt-Shift-key produce letters,
									Opt-CapsLock-key should produce the same character as Opt-key
									(not Opt-Shift-key). The following changes were requested by
									Mark Davis (he made me do them): (1) Rearranged Opt-Shift-key
									table so if Opt-key is dead, then Opt-Shift-key produces the
									accent by itself; this eliminates Opt-Shift entry of a few
									accented characters. (2) Changed dead key tables for tilde and
									circumflex so the character produced for a completor of space or
									no-match is the “real” accent character (code above $F0), not
									the low-ASCII approximation. All of the above changes are
									flagged with the symbol hasKCHRTweaks.
		 <5>	 3/23/90	PKE		Add name "US" for KCHR 0, remove names from Elmer KCAPs.
		 <4>	 2/27/90	PKE		Changed  KCAP resource conditionalization to use new, more
									specific hasXXXKeyLayouts symbols. Don't include Portable
									KCAPs in 7.0 System file.
		 <3>	  1/8/90	PKE		Replaced KCAPs 5,8,9 with formatted versions from KeyLayout.r,
									fixing a bug in the Elmer layouts: switched position of '+' and
									'-' keys. Restored the names for all of the KCAP resources.
		 <2>	12/20/89	dba		merged System and ROM keyboard information in this file; added
									KCAP resources from Key Layout
		 <1>	12/17/89	CCH		Adding for the first time into BBS.
	(BBS versions above, earlier versions below)
	   <1.2>	 5/22/89	PKE		(Esprit needs this too) Modified KCHR ID=0 for option-shift
									entry of double acute accent, code $FD
	   <1.1>	 4/12/89	PKE		Updated KCHR 0 to use Mac char set extensions; added KMAP 2.
	   <1.1>	 8/12/88	EMT		Added Harpo keyboard layout resources.
	   <1.0>	 2/12/88	BBM		Adding file for the first time into EASE…
	  <C928>	 11/4/87	EMT		Kbd.r: Update to include changes and fixes from SysResDef.r
									(e.g. S183)
	  <A262>	10/24/86	EMT		Removed Command-Shift-[<>?:"{}_+|~] feature, as it conflicts
									with MacPaint and MS Word
	  <A248>	10/20/86	EMT		Corrected ADB traps to return OSErr. Change to dead key table
									format.
	  <C219>	10/14/86	EMT		Fixed KbdType bug in kbd.a; added ASCII for function keys in
									kbd.r
				 10/7/86	EMT		new this date.
