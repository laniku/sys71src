> Release notes for this change:

We made some changes in the standard U.S. KCHR from System 6.0.7 to System 7 to allow entry of more characters and improve consistency in some option-shift key handling (we made similar changes from 6.0.3 to 6.0.4). However, some specialized fonts (and occasionally some apps) had some dependencies on the old System 6.0.7 keyboard layout. This is really their problem (they should NEVER depend on a particular key layout; if they do, they should supply their own). However, we are getting slammed for it from time to time in various articles and bulletin boards.

We can solve most of the problem by just adding the old layout as another choice for U.S. users; then makers of these fonts could tell their users to select the old layout in the Keyboard Control Panel (some vendors are already supplying the old layout as a keyboard icon to drag in). The old layout has been added with the name ÒU.S. - System 6.0.7Ó and an icon tentatively consisting of the U.S. flag with a boxed Ô6Õ in the lower right side. The KCHR adds 1422 bytes to the system file, and the icons add 192 bytes, but the KCHR will not take additional system heap space (since only one KCHR is resident at a time).

Installer note: Need to install KCHR (16383), kcs# (16383), kcs4 (16383). These are NOT needed for Disk Tools or any other minimum system.

User interface note: Need design input for keyboard icon.


> What was tested:

Full build. Pasted new KCHR and icons into Cube-E 36++ System file and rebooted. Verified that icon displays correctly in monochrome and 4bit/8bit color settings, in both Keyboard menu and Keyboard Control Panel. Verified that old keyboard could be selected in both. Compared new KCHR 16383 with KCHR 0 from System 6.0.7 to verify byte-for-byte identity.
