Radar bug: #1034096

> Release notes for this change:

The PPC Browser was using Geneva 12 as the hard-coded font and size for the lists. This
doesnÕt work for non-Roman primary scripts like Japanese. I changed the font used to 1
which will cause the application font to be used, and I changed the size used to 0 which
will use the ÒdefaultÓ font size. This will cause the correct font and size to be used in
non-Roman script systems.

Note that this has no real effect on the Roman system since Geneva 12 is the application
font and default size.

> What was tested:

I used the PPC browser (from Hypercard as in the bug) in a Roman system and verified that
it came up in Geneva 12 just like before. Then I used the PPC browser from a system with
Japanese as the primary script. Osaka 12 was used. I made sure that a machine with a
Japanese name was displayed correctly.

Finally, I used Macsbug to change the text size used to 14 and made sure that the lists
would format correctly with non-12 point text. This is important in case a script system
wants to use a size other than 12 for its default size.

Radar bug: 

> Release notes for this change:

Reality update:  Fix gestalt calls to use new prototype (not code change just type
declarations).  Partially updated gestalt header file (except I did not move the error
declarations that should probably be in Errors.h and I did not change the formatting
differences).

> What was tested:

Build and tested.  Found one technically incorrect declaration (but implemented correctly
in assmbler.  Other than that everything seems to work fine.
